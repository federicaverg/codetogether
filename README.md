# Required dependencies to install (IMPORTANT)

CRACO is used to get an easier configuration and customization of the app on top of the benefits of crate-react-app. We need to install chaco-less to have a Less file support, as required and specified in the Customization Theme documentation of the Ant Design library (check https://ant.design/docs/react/use-with-create-react-app). Run the following command in the project directory:

## `npm add craco-less`

Secondly, to be able to connect to the database, we need to install nodemon. Change into the backend directory, and install nodemon.

## `cd backend`

## `npm install nodemon`

Finally, it’s needed to overwrite the prims.js file for code formatting and syntax-highlighting. Navigate to the node_modules folder, find the prismjs folder and then overwrite the prism.js file with the following code:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
